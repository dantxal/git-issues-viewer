#### This is a non-commercial app I built during "Rocketseat's Bootcamp 8.0". 

# Technologies

- React
- Axios and GitHub's api
- Styled Components
- Eslint
- Prettier

## Description
It consumes github's api and allows you to keep track of your
favorite git repositories with a simplified UI. Explore the repos you
like and find some issues to solve, and feel great doing it.

## Want to see it running?

I published the app on Netlify in the following URL: https://dreamy-yonath-6ecb4e.netlify.com/

## Job opportunity? Feel free to contact me, I'm currently looking for a job in São Paulo-Brazil or even a remote one. 
### I'm available for relocation to other countries aswell.
